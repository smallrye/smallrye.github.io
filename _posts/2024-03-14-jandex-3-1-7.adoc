= Jandex 3.1.7

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.1.7[release] of Jandex 3.1.7.
This release contains several small fixes and improvements.

A few utility methods are added to improve quality of life:

* `Type.create(Class)` to create a `Type` object from `java.lang.Class`
* `PrimitiveType.box()` and `unbox()` static methods for converting between primitive types and primitive wrapper classes

Two bugs were fixed in `AnnotationInstanceBuilder` when adding class-valued members:

* if given a `Class` object, it was always assumed that it represents a class type; the `void` pseudo-type, primitive types and array types were not handled correctly
* if given a `Type` object that represents a multi-dimensional array, it was incorrectly rejected

A bug was fixed in sorting classes during type annotation propagation.
Similar problem was already fixed before, but it turned out that with bytecode obfuscation, the previous fix was not effective.

Finally, some dependencies of the Jandex Maven plugin were updated, mainly to fix a possible issue with indexing reproducibility.
Thanks Jorge Sol√≥rzano for the pull request!
