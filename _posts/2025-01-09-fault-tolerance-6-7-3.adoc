= Fault Tolerance 6.7.3

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/6.7.3[release] of {smallrye-ft} 6.7.3.
This release contains one bugfix.

In the link:/blog/fault-tolerance-6-7-2[previous release], the event loop integration was significantly improved.
That improvement, alas, contains a bug in the Vert.x integration.
We assumed that a Vert.x thread is always associated with a current Vert.x context, but that doesn't have to be the case.
Especially in case of a worker thread pool, which can be (in Quarkus, for example) used as a classic thread pool as well and tasks can be submitted to it outside of a Vert.x context.
This wrong assumption lead to a NPE, which is fixed now.

As usual, if you have any ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues[file an issue]!
