= Jandex 3.2.3

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.2.3[release] of Jandex 3.2.3.
This release contains one small bugfix and one small improvement.

The `Type.parse()` method was added.
This method parses a string (according to a documented grammar) and produces a Jandex `Type`.

The `Index.singleClass()` method now works properly when the passed class object in fact represents a module descriptor.

If you experience any troubles, or if you have any ideas for Jandex improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/issues[file an issue].
