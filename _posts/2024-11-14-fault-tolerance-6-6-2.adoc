= Fault Tolerance 6.6.2

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/6.6.2[release] of {smallrye-ft} 6.6.2.
This release contains two small bugfixes.

The `@BeforeRetry` annotation didn't work correctly when guarding asynchronous actions (returning `CompletionStage`, `Uni` etc.).
This bug has been fixed in this release.

The support for multiple metric providers was fixed to work properly in EE environments like WildFly.

As usual, if you have any ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues[file an issue]!
