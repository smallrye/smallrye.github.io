= Jandex 3.2.4

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.2.4[release] of Jandex 3.2.4.
This release contains one small improvement.

The `JandexReflection.loadType()` method was added.
This method accepts a Jandex `Type` and returns a corresponding Reflection `Type`.
The result is equal to the reflectively obtained `Type` and has the same hash code, as long as there are no type variables.
The JDK implementation of `TypeVariable.equals()` checks for a specific implementation class, so proper equality is impossible to achieve in this case.

If you experience any troubles, or if you have any ideas for Jandex improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/issues[file an issue].
