= Fault Tolerance 5.4.1

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/5.4.1[release] of SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.4.1.
This is a small release with a few improvements.
It is a safe upgrade for everyone using SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.4.0.

Some trace-level logging messages were promoted to the debug level, and were enhanced with a description of the guarded method.

For the purpose of upcoming Quarkus dev UI for SmallRye Fault Tolerance, the entire _effective_ fault tolerance configuration is now visible from outside.

Some internal build-related improvements were also made.
