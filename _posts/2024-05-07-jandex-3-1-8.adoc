= Jandex 3.1.8

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.1.8[release] of Jandex 3.1.8.
This release contains two small improvements.

To locate a method from a `ClassInfo`, one had to use the `ClassInfo.method(String, Type\...)` method.
With this release, one can also use `ClassInfo.method(String, List<Type>)`.
Thanks Guillaume Smet for the issue!

Also, in this release, the runtime memory consumption of Jandex was significantly improved.

If you experience any troubles, or if you have any ideas for Jandex improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/issues[file an issue].
