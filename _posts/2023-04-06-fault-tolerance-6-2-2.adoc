= Fault Tolerance 6.2.2

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/6.2.2[release] of {smallrye-ft} 6.2.2.
This is a tiny release with one bugfix for programmatic API usage.

There are 2 variants of the {smallrye-ft} programmatic API: _standalone_ and _CDI_.
At runtime, only one of them should typically be present, but if there are both, a priority mechanism exists to disambiguate.
This priority mechanism had a bug which could lead to incorrect variant being selected.
The bug is now fixed and the programmatic API should work as expected.

And as usual, if you have any ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues[file an issue]!
