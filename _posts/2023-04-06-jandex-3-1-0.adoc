= Jandex 3.1.0

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.1.0[release] of Jandex 3.1.0.
It includes several improvements and bug fixes.

== Declarations

The top-level interface in the Jandex object model has always been an `AnnotationTarget`: something that can be annotated.
There are generally two kinds of things that can be annotated, speaking in Java terms: declarations and types (or type usages, to be more precise).
This distinction hasn't been reflected in the Jandex object model hierarchy, until now.

Jandex 3.1 adds the `Declaration` interface, which directly extends `AnnotationTarget`.
All classes that represent declarations now implement `Declaration`:

* `ClassInfo`
* `FieldInfo`
* `MethodInfo`
* `MethodParameterInfo`
* `RecordComponentInfo`

The only `AnnotationTarget` that isn't `Declaration` is:

* `TypeTarget`

The `EquivalenceKey` hierarchy also has a `DeclarationEquivalenceKey`, so that it corresponds to the `AnnotationTarget` hierarchy.

This is a small change that should significantly improve usage of Jandex as a language model.
It is very common to only care about annotated declarations, but for now, there hasn't been a way to distinguish them from annotated type usages.
The `Declaration` interface serves this very purpose.

== Factories and builders for types

There are different ways to instantiate a Jandex `Type`.
The `Type.create()` static method is not very easy to use, and the concrete subclasses of `Type` over time accumulated different static factory methods as well.

Jandex 3.1 adds a comprehensive set of static factory methods and builders to all complex ``Type``s:

* `ClassType`
* `ArrayType`
* `ParameterizedType`
* `TypeVariable`
* `WildcardType`

All these classes have a set of static factory methods called `create()`, sufficient for the most common cases.
They also have a static method called `builder()` that returns a builder, usable for the less common cases, including type annotations.

== Array types representation

The `ArrayType` class in Jandex models Java array types.
The Jandex representation, incidentally, is very different from the Java language representation, yet has always used the same terminology.

Quick refresher: in Java, array types have a component type and an element type.
For example, in case of `int[][]`, the element type is `int`, while the component type is `int[]` (whose component type is `int`).
In Jandex, `int[][]` has always been represented as a tuple: `{ componentType = int, dimensions = 2 }`.

This shows the first issue: conflicting terminology.
The term _component type_ in Jandex has always meant something else than in Java.

That's not everything, though.
To faithfully represent type annotations on the dimensions of the array, Jandex sometimes has to use an array type as the component type of an array type.
For example, the type `String[] @Ann []` has to be represented as an array with 1 dimension, whose component type is an array type `String @Ann []`.
The component type of that, in turn, is `String`.

As you can see, this is completely different from the Java representation.
This is usually not a big deal, because annotations on array dimensions are rare and multi-dimensional arrays are significantly less common than single-dimensional, but it still causes confusion.

With the release of Jandex 3.1, this is no more.

What Jandex used to call _component type_ of an array is now named _constituent type_.
To access the Jandex representation, the following methods exist:

* `constituent()`: this method is new
* `dimensions()`: this method has existed before and hasn't been changed to avoid breaking compatibility

Methods to access the Java representation of array types are added:

* `elementType()`
* `componentType()`
* `deepDimensions()`

One method has been deprecated:

* `component()`: this method has existed before and hasn't been changed to avoid breaking compatibility

== Reconstructing descriptors and generic signatures

Advanced users of Jandex, such as Quarkus, sometimes have to reconstruct a descriptor or a generic signature of some Jandex object.
In this release, Jandex has this functionality built-in, accessible through two interfaces: `Descriptor` and `GenericSignature`.

Jandex classes that implement the `Descriptor` interface are able to reconstruct their bytecode descriptor.
Similarly, Jandex classes that implement the `GenericSignature` interface are able to reconstruct their generic signature and also return whether a generic signature is actually required.

Both descriptor and signature reconstruction can optionally perform type variable substitution.
That is, if a type variable occurs when reconstructing the descriptor, the corresponding part of the descriptor may instead describe another type returned by a given substitution function (same for signatures).

== Other

Previously, Jandex used to fail when invalid generic signature occured in the indexed bytecode.
It turns out that ECJ may produce invalid generic signature on pretty basic code (synthetic static method generated for a lambda), so with Jandex 3.1, invalid signatures are simply ignored.
Thanks HÃ©lios Gilles for providing a reproducer!

With great help from Francesco Nigro, a lot of performance improvements to the indexing process were made.
On large JARs, we've seen roughly 20% improvements in indexing speed and 50% improvements in allocation rate.
Thank you!

Finally, Brian Demers and Guillaume Nodet provided fixes for build reproducibility.
(Note that this is not an intentionally supported feature and it's only maintained on a best effort basis.)
Thanks!

== Summary

This release brings a lot of changes, but none of them break backward compatibility.
The persistent format of Jandex has not changed either, so upgrade should be safe for everyone.
