= Fault Tolerance 6.4.0

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/6.4.0[release] of {smallrye-ft} 6.4.0.
This release contains one new feature and one bugfix.

The `@BeforeRetry` annotation was added, together with the corresponding methods in the programmatic API.
The annotation allows defining an action that should happen before each retry, but not before the initial attempt.
See the https://smallrye.io/docs/smallrye-fault-tolerance/6.4.0/reference/retry.html#_before_retry_actions[documentation] for more information.

Further, the `synchronized` keyword was replaced on one place with a `ReentrantLock`, making the programmatic API more friendly with virtual threads.

As usual, if you have any ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues[file an issue]!
