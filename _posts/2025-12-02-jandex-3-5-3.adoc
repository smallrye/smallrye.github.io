= Jandex 3.5.3

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.5.3[release] of Jandex 3.5.3.
This release contains a few small improvements.

`EquivalenceKey` performance was improved, thanks to some wonderful ideas of Francesco Nigro.
Notably, caching of `ClassTypeEquivalenceKey` was improved, and the exact same caching approach was added to `ClassEquivalenceKey`, which previously had no caching at all.
Also, all `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods were improved to avoid null-safe calls (`Objects.equals()`, `Objects.hashCode()`), because all fields in these classes are never `null`.

The `StringBuilderGen` implementation (in the `gizmo2` module) was updated to latest improvements in Gizmo 2.

If you experience any troubles, or if you have any ideas for Jandex improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/issues[file an issue].
