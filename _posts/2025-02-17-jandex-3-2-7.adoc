= Jandex 3.2.7

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.2.7[release] of Jandex 3.2.7.
This release contains one bugfix.

An annotation overlay configured to include inherited annotations didn't necessarily work correctly when asked for annotations on the `Object` class, depending on the underlying `IndexView` implementation.
That was fixed in this release: when the passed class does not have a superclass (which means it is `Object`), the index is not queried at all.
Thanks Matěj Novotný for the issue and pull request!
