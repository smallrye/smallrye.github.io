= Fault Tolerance 5.3.2

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/5.3.2[release] of SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3.2.
This is a small release with one bug fix.
It is a safe upgrade for everyone using SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3.1.

In link:/blog/fault-tolerance-5-3/[SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3], we revamped the support for additional async types.
During that refactoring, we introduced a bug that manifests in environments with security manager enabled.
In this release, the bug is fixed.
