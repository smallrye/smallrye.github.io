= Jandex 3.0.3

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/releases/tag/3.0.3[release] of Jandex 3.0.3.
It includes one small bug fix.

It turns out some JVM languages (e.g. Groovy) may generate inner classes where the constructor doesn't take an enclosing instance as a parameter.
Jandex since version 3.0.0 assumed that inner classes always have such constructor parameter.
This release relaxes this assumption so that Groovy classes can be indexed correctly.
Thanks Emond Papegaaij for the report!

As usual, if you experience any troubles, or if you have any ideas for Jandex improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/issues[file an issue].
