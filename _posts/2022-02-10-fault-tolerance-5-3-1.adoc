= Fault Tolerance 5.3.1

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/5.3.1[release] of SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3.1.
This is a small release with one bug fix.
It is a safe upgrade for everyone using SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3.0.

In link:/blog/fault-tolerance-5-3/[SmallRye Fault Tolerance 5.3], we revamped the support for additional async types.
During that refactoring, we introduced a bug that manifests in environments with complex classloading requirements, such as WildFly.
In this release, the bug is fixed.

Additionally, the programmatic API documentation was slightly improved.
