= Fault Tolerance 6.9.3

Today, we announce the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/6.9.3[release] of {smallrye-ft} 6.9.3.
This release contains one small improvement.

{smallrye-ft} is not a tiny project anymore; these days, it consists of roughly 15 subprojects.
Therefore, starting with this release, we provide a BOM: `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-bom`.
Use this BOM to manage version numbers of all {smallrye-ft} modules.

As usual, if you have any ideas for improvements, please https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/issues[file an issue]!
